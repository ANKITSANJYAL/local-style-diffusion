Project Proposal: Local Prompt Adaptation for Style-Consistent Multi-Object Generation in Diffusion Models
Title
Local Prompt Adaptation for Style-Consistent Multi-Object Generation in Diffusion Models
________________


Problem Statement
While state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion XL) demonstrate impressive generation quality, they struggle with prompt compositionality involving:
1. Multiple objects with distinct attributes or relationships.

2. Consistent global or local styles (e.g., "vaporwave," "cyberpunk") across all entities.

For example, generating "a cat on a flying car in vaporwave style" often produces scenes where only one element reflects the style, or the spatial layout is incoherent. This limits controllability and artistic coherence in creative applications.

Proposed Method
We propose a training-free architectural method called Local Prompt Adaptation (LPA) which improves style consistency and multi-object spatial control in text-to-image diffusion generation.
1. Prompt Token Segmentation
   * Parse input prompts into subphrases using off-the-shelf syntactic parsers (e.g., spaCy).

   * Separate object tokens and style tokens:

      * Example: Prompt: "A cat on a flying car in vaporwave style"

         * Object tokens: ["cat", "flying car"]

         * Style tokens: ["vaporwave"]

2. Controlled Cross-Attention Injection
            * Identify relevant U-Net cross-attention layers across timesteps $t \in {10, 20, 30, ..., 50}$.

            * Inject object tokens into early U-Net layers (e.g., down blocks) to control coarse layout.

            * Inject style tokens into middle and late blocks (mid & up blocks) to refine stylistic consistency.

3. Spatial Attention Localization
               * At inference, record cross-attention maps $A_{ij}^t$ from U-Net.

               * Use these maps to derive which spatial regions attend to which tokens.

               * Optionally visualize per-token activation maps (useful for user understanding).

4. Style Consistency Loss (Optional, with Re-Ranking)
                  * After generation, compute region-wise CLIP/DINO embeddings for different objects.

                  * Calculate the style-consistency loss:

Lstyle=∑i=1ND(fclip(Ri),fclip(S))\mathcal{L}_{style} = \sum_{i=1}^N D(f_{clip}(R_i), f_{clip}(S))
Where $R_i$ is the patch embedding of object $i$, $S$ is the style token embedding, and $D$ is cosine distance.
                     * Use this to re-rank N generated samples (e.g., N = 4) per prompt.

Dataset & Prompts
1. Dataset
                        * Prompts Only: No training needed. We generate synthetic data.

                        * Use Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL 1.0) as base model via diffusers.

2. Prompt Set (50 Total Prompts)
Create 5 categories:
Category A: Simple Multi-Object with Style (10)

                           * A dog on a hoverboard in synthwave style

Category B: Scene + Object + Style (10)
                              * A waterfall in the background and a temple in ukiyo-e style

                              * A city skyline and a flying dragon in fantasy art style

                                 * A samurai and a monk meditating in cel-shaded style

                                 * A ballerina and a robot dancing in Pixar style

Category D: Mixed Animals + Urban Style (10)
                                    * A lion walking next to a bus stop in neo-noir style

                                    * A frog on a skyscraper in graffiti street art style

Category E: Abstract Concepts + Style (10)
                                       * Time and memory portrayed in cubist art

                                       * A quantum computer and a butterfly in 90s anime style

Evaluation Metrics
1. Style Consistency Score (CLIP/DINO)
                                          * Extract per-object patch embeddings and style embedding

                                          * Compute average cosine similarity (higher = better)

2. LPIPS (Perceptual Distance)
                                             * Use LPIPS to compare generated images to nearest stylistic exemplars (or among each other)
