RESEARCH QUESTION INSIGHTS:
------------------------------
Q1: Does injection order matter?
  ⚠️  Insufficient data to determine


RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------
• Investigate 6 failed variants
• Consider adjusting parameters for failed variants
• Run additional experiments with different injection schedules
• Conduct user studies to validate findings
